<h1>RXJS Operators</h1>
<p>Operators are RXJS tools that can transform the data being passed through the data stream</p>
<div class="observable-container">
  <div><input type="text" (keyup)="typeWord($event)" placeholder="Type something here"></div>
  @if(result){
    <div>After one second you wrote: {{result}}</div>
  }
</div>
<p>The delay operator delays the emission of items from the source Observable by a given timeout or until a given Date.
